Lithuanian law only allows to work abroad remotely 180 days in a year. This peace of code allows to easily track the number of days user worked from abroad already or plan the future. When using for the first time, user has to fill in the dates in which he already worked from abroad.  To calculate number of days, dataset containing each day of a year as a separate row is created. Then that dataset is filtered separately for each date user worked from abroad. Sizes of those datasets are calculated and the sum of those is the number of days worked from abroad.  Besides that, it also allows to change date of when a year ends, allowing to plan the future easier.
